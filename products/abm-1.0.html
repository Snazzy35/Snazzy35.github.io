        Good, but needs some improvement
    <br>
    <br>
Overall, I love the Automatic Bed Maker. It is nice and easy to use and it works well. Three minor issues, though:  First, it uses a lot of power. For a first generation product, this is pretty good, but they need to use less power. This should not be a problem, just something to be aware of. Second, It makes a lot of noise. So many motors, robotic arms, and other parts that it is bound to make some noise. It is just a little annoying, hearing that robotic hum while it is doing its job. Third, it is a bit big. Your bed has to be off the wall a little for this to fit. All very minor in my opinion, but just something to look out for. Overall, I love this. Service was great, product was quality, everything went smooth. If you are looking at one of these, maybe wait for the next model that will come out. It will probably fix many of these flaws, as most second generation products do. </p1>
