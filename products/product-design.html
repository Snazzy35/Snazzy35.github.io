<h1> What is the Automatic Bed Maker?</h1>
<!-- This is a header, a medium text size !-->
<p1> Ever wanted to not make your bed in the morning? We may have the perfect solution for you! </p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>The automatic Bed Maker is a machine that automatically makes your bed for you. We make them for King, Queen, and Full size beds.</p1>

<p> The Automatic Bed Maker comes with a strap, a remote, and the machine. Beds are not included. You use the strap and hook it to the back of the bed, and then use your remote to activate the Bed Maker. The tech arms will immediately move and make the bed neatly. How long it takes depends on the size of the bed, with an estimate of five to eight minutes. After the Bed Maker realizes it is finished, it will automatically turn off, so you don't have to go back up to your room and turn it off yourself. It is super easy to use all across the board! </p>
