    <p1> Our amazing technology has allowed our customers of all ages to live in a world of laziness. These days people are busy, lazy, and unable to make the bed. With our product we envisioned a world where people can be lazy while having a nice and neat bed. So today everyone can be lazy without being looked down upon. We have also improved power efficiency and lowered the price compared to our previous generation. </p1>

    Very impressed!

 I got this because it is cool technology that I could use. I was amazed at how smooth it was. Out of the box, it was not great. But after being tuned, it worked amazing! This makes my bed in under 5 minutes. Absolutely worth the $500 that I paid for it. If you can get it on sale, even better! </p1>
