    <p1> Nathan McMinn: 
        <br>
General Manager
<br>
Hi, I'm Nathan. I am a hard worker who especially enjoys technology, Math, and Coding. The main thing I worked on was the website. I have also done a bit of everything else with help from my other team members. 
<br>
<br>
Lukas Poore:
<br>
CFO
<br>
In this journey of the Automatic Bed Maker, Lukas has been a very important person. He has been helping me greatly over the time that I have been doing this. He has made my job so much easier.
<br>
<br>
Caden Lindley:
<br>
Advertising Manager
<br>
Caden has been another good member of the team. Besides being a great friend, he has also done his job very well. He has helped get our product into the public, thus his role of Advertising Manager
<br>
<br>
Joseph Ward:
<br>
Production Manager
<br>
Joseph was a last-minute addition to our team, but I'm glad he is here. He has helped much with marketing, the Business Plan, and various other tasks around the company, mostly 3D Models and advertisments.
<br>
<br>
Overall, we have a great team, and I am glad that they are all here.
